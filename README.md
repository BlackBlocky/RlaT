# RlaT (In C++ embeddable programming languages)

A statically typed scripting language that is easy to add to any cpp application.

Current its just a fun project, and very very early development. So there isn't much to see for now.<br>
The name "RlaT" stands for "Runs like a Tutrle", because I dont think this language is going to be pretty fast :P
